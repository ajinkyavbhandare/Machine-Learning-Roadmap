## Introduction

  Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started in machine learning or an experienced practitioner looking to deepen your knowledge, this roadmap is designed to help you navigate the vast array of resources available.

The roadmap is divided into six steps: Prerequisite, Machine Learning, Advance Machine Learning, Machine Learning System Design, Model Deployment and MLops (optional), and Additional Resources. Each step builds on the previous one, starting with foundational skills and progressing to more advanced techniques and applications.

Whether you're looking to learn about supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, or model deployment, this roadmap has you covered. We've included a variety of resources, including online courses, tutorials, and practice questions, to help you build a strong foundation in machine learning and advance your skills.

I hope this roadmap helps you on your journey to becoming a machine learning expert!

## Prerequisite

Before diving into machine learning, it's important to have a strong foundation in programming and data analysis. These prerequisite resources will help you build the necessary skills.

- [Beginner Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=400s)
- [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8)
- [Data Cleaning with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)
- Note: While web scraping can be useful in obtaining data for machine learning projects, it is not a fundamental skill required for machine learning.
